            Usually, when using JWT authentication, 
            the client side stores the token somewhere and attaches it to every request that needs authentication.
            So, the first thing to do when logging out is just to delete the token you stored on the client (e.i. browser local storage).
            In that case, the client won‚Äôt have a token to put in the request, thus causing unauthorized response status
            But is that enough? Well, that specific client (browser, app) won‚Äôt be authenticated anymore,
            but the token still exists somewhere and it is still valid! If someone has copied the token from the request before, 
            he/she would still be able to perform requests on behalf of the user! üëæ You can easily try this out on your own.
            ‚ÄúOkay, so let‚Äôs log out the user from the backend!‚Äù you would say. But hold down the horses. It‚Äôs not that simple with JWT. You cannot delete the session or cookie and get going.

            Actually, JWT serves a different purpose than a session and it is not possible to forcefully delete or invalidate an existing token.
            
            ^ Statelessness?
            The whole point of JWT is to be stateless.
            It is said that using JWT should be stateless, 
            meaning that you should store everything you need in the payload and skip performing a DB query on every request.
            But if you plan to have a strict log out functionality, that cannot wait for the token auto-expiration, 
            even though you have cleaned the token from the client side, 
            then you might need to neglect the stateless logic and do some queries.
            * An implementation would probably be, to store a so-called ‚Äúblacklist‚Äù of all the tokens that are valid no more and have not expired yet.
