# Node.js and Express Todo List GetItDone App

This is a simple todo list application built using Node.js and Express framework. It allows users to add, edit, and delete todos and subtodos.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB >> https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
- Postman >> https://www.postman.com/downloads/
- Express.js >> https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
    ```
     MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     API_PORT=<port-number>
     # Token key for JWT authentication >> It's just a random string for now
     JWT_TOKEN_KEY= A random String!
    ```
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start the server
6. Open your postman and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/todos/$whatever` to test the endpoints >> see the usage section below for the endpoints

## Architecture
 - The application is built using Node.js and Express framework.
 - The application uses MongoDB as the database.
 - The application uses Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.
 - The application uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, Where the model is the data, the view is the user interface (or API), and the controller is the brains of the application, which handles the logic and incoming requests.
 - The application uses Restful API architecture, where the API is designed to have logical endpoints that are easy to understand and remember.

## What is the MVC architecture?
Model View Controller is a software architectural pattern that involves the separation of the application logic into three interconnected elements the Model, View, and Controller.

## Description
- `index.js` is the entry point of the application.
- `controllers` folder contains the controllers that handle the logic for each route.
- `models` folder contains the database models.
- `routes` folder contains the route definitions for the API.
- `services` folder contains the business logic and communicates with the database.

## What is RESTful API?
REST is an acronym for Representation State Transfer, API on the other hand is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data.


## Usage

This application can be tested using an API development tool like Postman. You can use the following endpoints to interact with the API:

### User Endpoints
1. GET /user/register
    To register a new user.
2. GET /user/login
    To login a user.

### Todo Endpoints 
#### All todo endpoints require a valid token in the request header. You can get a token by registering a new user or logging in an existing user.
1. GET /todos
    To get a list of all todos.

2. GET /todos/:todoId
    To get a single todo, where :todoId is the ID of the todo you want to retrieve.

3. GET /todos/get-sub-todo/:todoId/:subTodoId
    To get a single sub-todo, where :todoId is the ID of the parent todo and :subTodoId is the ID of the sub-todo you want to retrieve.

4. POST /todos/new
    To create a new todo, with the todo details in the request body.

5. POST /todos/new-sub-todo/:todoId
    To create a new sub-todo for a specific todo, with the sub-todo details in the request body and :todoId as the ID of the parent todo.

6. PUT /todos/update/:todoId
    To update a todo, with the updated todo details in the request body and :todoId as the ID of the todo.

7. PUT /todos/update-sub-todo/:todoId/:subTodoId
    To update a sub-todo, with the updated sub-todo details in the request body, :todoId as the ID of the parent todo, and :subTodoId as the ID of the sub-todo.

8. DELETE /todos/delete/:todoId
    To delete a todo, where :todoId is the ID of the todo you want to delete.

9. DELETE /todos/delete-sub-todo/:todoId/:subTodoId
    To delete a sub-todo, where :todoId is the ID of the parent todo and :subTodoId is the ID of the sub-todo you want to delete.
